I searched for a library, but none of the options on the first page of Google were easy to implement or had good documentation, so I decided to create my own module.</p><p>The name isn't anything special; custom elements need a hyphen to work according to the rules. I wrote 'sexy' as a placeholder, but I kept it because the development was well advanced when I wanted to change it, and honestly, I couldn't think of anything better XD</p><p>I published a <a href='http://www.niupleis.com/projects/sexy-knob/'>demo on my website</a>, and the source code is available in the <a href='https://github.com/tnkii-dev/sexy-knob/'>GitHub repository</a>.</p><img src='images/sexy-knobDemo.gif'>"

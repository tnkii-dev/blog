''The Vault'' is where Prince kept recordings and unreleased material: songs, videos, movies, and other projects that Prince never released.<br>He stored material since the 80's, it is said that there are thousands of songs, music videos, recorded concerts, and experiments.<br>A good part of this material has been released posthumously since Prince died in 2016.</p><p>I am not much of a creator now, I am an ideas person. I keep notes and links and everything, but it has always been a challenge to store and categorize my ideas because I have no organization.<br>I jot things down on paper, or save links in notes and chats, but everything gets mixed up and I lose track of where to find things:</p><img src='images/240622_1.jpg' alt='notebook and sketchbook'><img src='images/240622_2.jpg' alt='folders of notes'><img src='images/240622_4.jpg' alt='volume of folders of notes'><img src='images/240622_3.jpg' alt='example of chat with notes'><p>But it occurred to me that I can use a part of my website to organize everything better, that's why I am going to make my own vault at <a href='https://niupleis.com/vault'>niupleis.com/vault</a> (Not available yet). This way, I can always access my ideas and also share them publicly. That will be my <span style='color:#00ff33; font-family:monospace;'>1-UP</span> to Prince XD</p><p>The only problem is that it will take me some time to put everything in order on the page.</p><p>Well, bye!</p>"

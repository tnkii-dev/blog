Entries are now JSON files and I create them with the help of a script; before, I used to make each page in HTML by hand xD</p><p>I added some important features such as the ability to change languages<a href='#fig'>(1)</a>, and there are four languages to choose from: Spanish, my first language; Japanese and Korean for my target market; and English. The language selector is in a small menu on the main page and in a corner in the entry reader<a href='#fig2'>(1.1)</a>.</p><p>I also added the ability to filter entries by content type<a href='#fig'>(2)</a>, as well as a reload button for entries<a href='#fig'>(3)</a>.</p><p style='color: #ff0;'>It's important to clarify that these features use cookies to function. More information is available on the main page<a href='#fig'>(4)</a> or by pressing ctrl+shift+i.</p><p>Another important addition was an About Me section, in the form of a biography<a href='#fig'>(5)</a>, which explains who I am and what this blog is for.</p><p>Finally, and most importantly, I implemented a donations button<a href='#fig'>(6)</a>, which works with Ko-fi because I found the implementation simple. For now, I understand it may be useless; the main page is practically finished, it just needs to be made visually appealing, i.e., filled with content, art, and whatever else. Any support will be appreciated :)</p><img id='fig' src='images/root_novedad.webp'><img id='fig2' src='images/entry_novedad.webp'><p>I deleted some previous posts, those that I rushed and others that were incomplete.</p>"

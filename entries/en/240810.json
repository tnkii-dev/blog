  "content": "<p>As you might notice, I’ve made some significant changes to the main page of this blog. I’m working on the illustrations for niupleis.com so it can go live, but I can’t publish it without some drawings... But art takes time, so I’m working on some icons right now:</p><div style='display:flex;'><img src='images/240809_Lis.jpg'><img src='images/240809_Mishil.jpg'></div><div style='display:flex;'><img src='images/240809_Jiwoon.jpg'><img src='images/240809_Chaery.jpg'></div><p>I enjoy drawing for a long time, I do it in a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)'>flow state,</a> but it drains my energy when it’s over, so I either procrastinate or do something else. It’s usually the former, but today I chose to do something different. On my \"to-do list,\" I had \"remodel blog,\" because it was looking pretty ugly:</p><img src='images/240809_antes.png'><p>So I deleted \"style.css\" and started adding style from scratch. I added things that will be on niupleis.com: a cookie notice, a footer with the niupleis logo and my links, a wallpaper, and changes to the side menus.<br>I changed how posts appear on the page and added something I’ve needed for a while: a display of the memes I bake.</p><img src='images/240809_ahora.png'><p>This isn’t the final style; I might want to add more things later.<br>I want to launch niupleis.com before the first anniversary of this blog, but for that, I need to finish the illustrations, so that’s what I’ll be working on. I might post updates here or on <a href='https://youtube.com/@idol_wannabe'>my YouTube channel.</a></p><p>In the meantime, check out the memes, bye!!!</p>"

    "content": "<p>In 1975, Mihály Csikszentmihályi proposed the concept of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)' style='text-decoration:underline;'>flow</a>, which is when you focus on an activity to the point where it's the only thing occupying your energy at that moment. I am well acquainted with that state; when I draw, when I write code, when I write, and when I listen to music.</p><p>Flow requires special conditions. For me, it happens when there is no<span style='color:#dd5;'>noise</span>, no<span style='color:#dd5;'>light</span>, and no<span>people</span> (my three enemies).</p><p>Understandably, it's during the night that it's more likely for everyone being asleep to mean there's less noise, less social media activity, and fewer interruptions in general, allowing for better concentration.</p><p>And even when not working on something, the tranquility is inspiring. This very blog is being written at 2:24 a.m.</p><p>Another thing that happens is that the most screwed-up thoughts can be expressed. The previous paragraph is self-referential, it's meta, and meta things give me a strange sensation; I read philosophy and those things tend to happen. And that's good.</p>"

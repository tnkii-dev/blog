It took me who knows how long, but this new page I built from scratch in two days.</p><p>I added two new sections to the homepage: Live and Articles.</p><h3>1. Live.</h3><p>This section that looks like a chat is exactly that, a one-sided chat. I’ve neglected this page because writing these blogs takes some time; I can’t just write any nonsense and publish it. But in that chat, I can—it’s perfect for short messages or sharing simple things.</p><h3>2. Articles.</h3><p>Initially, I intended to use this blog to write about research on things I came across on the internet, strange rabbit holes, or worthwhile articles. I did it a couple of times, but I didn’t love it—it didn’t fit well with the rest of the content here. But now I have a section specifically designed for that. For now, it’s empty, but it’s only a matter of time before it’s filled with stuff.</p><p>That’s all for now. I’ll be updating soon.<br>Goodbye!!!</p>"

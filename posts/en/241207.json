It’s been ready for a while, and I was waiting to finish a project before launching it so it wouldn’t feel empty. However, I decided to launch it before the year ends. I hope to have some content to show before the 31st, but it seems unlikely.</p><p>The only new addition is the <a href=\"https://niupleis.com/vault/\">/vault/</a> section, which I’ve mentioned in a past blog. In fact, it’s the only section with content so far, besides the gallery.</p><p>The character that brings the header to life hasn’t been introduced yet, but I hope to do so soon.</p><p>Below the header, you’ll see a section that simply says “Coming soon.” That’s an important part that I have to postpone due to lack of content.</p><p>I hope having the site online now will motivate me to work on the things I’ve been putting off.</p><p>Anyway, enjoy the little content I can offer.<br>Goodbye!!!</p>"

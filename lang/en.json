I compose and produce music although I don't have any songs published yet. I'm an apprentice in piano and violin.<br><br>I'm a programmer, I code my own tools and I'm learning game development. The craziest thing I do is study languages, my first language is Spanish, I study Japanese, Korean, and Chinese, and I can speak English.<br><br>Other things I do: I take photos of the sky, analyze pop music, browse the internet, plan to make YouTube videos, and share fan art on Twitter. I 'plan' but I don't go try hard because social media hasn't worked for me, that's why I made this blog, don't even mention TikTok.<br><br>I also have specific tastes, I watch anime and some animated series, I read history and philosophy books, and occasionally European literature. I like Dubstep music, pre-2010 pop, j-pop, and c-pop, and also music related to anime, but mainly I listen to Vocaloid and K-Pop.<br><br>I'm a university student but I also study on my own, I study subjects related to my interests and some exact sciences: Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, and Computer Science.",

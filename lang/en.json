  "text_bio": "Here, many things are shared. I mainly document the things I learn, but also other interests and hobbies I have.<br><br>I am an illustrator, focused on anime style. I compose and produce music, although I don't have any songs published yet. I am learning piano and violin.<br><br>I am a programmer; I develop my own tools and am learning game development. The craziest thing I do is study languages. My first language is Spanish, I study Japanese, Korean, and Chinese, and I can speak English.<br><br>Other things I do: I take photographs of the sky, analyze pop music, browse the internet, plan to make YouTube videos, and share fanart on Twitter. I 'plan' but don't go try-hard because social media hasn't worked for me, so I made this blog instead. Let's not even talk about TikTok.<br><br>I also have specific tastes. I watch anime and some animated series, read history and philosophy books, and occasionally European literature. I like Dubstep music, pre-2010s pop, J-pop, C-pop, and music related to anime, but I mainly listen to Vocaloid and K-Pop.<br><br>I am a university student, but I also self-study. I study subjects related to my interests and some exact sciences: Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, and Computer Science.",
